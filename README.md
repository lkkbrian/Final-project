**Title:** Laser flashlight

**Description:** 
>A multipurposed led flashlight with laser built in.

**How is this responsive to the environment:**
>This flashlight takes searching things to a wider sense. Not only does it contain a LED in it, it has blinking mode for SOS signaling and laser in it to make pin point locating. With a slightly concaved lens, the LED can project the light in a brighter, broader range, which makes finding things more efficient.

**Controls**
>The flashlight is controlled with a potentiometer instead of a button to easily adjust the light modes needed to use.
