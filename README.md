# Final-project

**Title:** Thermo images

**Description:** 
>By using thermo sensors and have it attateched to my fingertips like a glove, it can detect the temperature of objects or organisms when I touched them. As the temperature is being read, a monitor displays the image of how temperature might look like. This could be achieved by inputting a equation/formula to the program, so the image changes based on the reading of the temperature. I can try using a formula that allows both positive and negative temperature to show images.

**How is this responsive to the environment:**
>Since temperature is just a concept that is unperceivable with our naked eye, it will be great to know how to how temperature looks viusally. I know through infrared, we can see how hot or cold the human body is, but I want to do things differently and creatively. Just like how soundwaves can create pattern, I want to try making temperatures crete patterns and images too.
